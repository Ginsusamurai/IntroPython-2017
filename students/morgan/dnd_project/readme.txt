This package is designed to build monsters and encounters for:
Dungeons and Dragons 5e

The level of each Player Character can be added, the DM can determine
the relative threat level desired and an encounter with appropriately
designed monsters will be generated to meet the specs.

Encounters are based on:
Number and Level of each PC
Does the DM want to forbid attacks strong enough to 1-shot the weakest PC
The expected difficulty of the encounter (easy, medium, hard, deadly, deadly+)
The number of entities in the encounter
Are there any "Paragon Monsters"
